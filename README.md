# World Cup Dashboard

## Description
This project involves extracting, profiling, and analyzing FIFA World Cup data. The focus of this project was to create two dashboards which include key information, such as the top 10 best teams, the top 10 best players, the highest scoring countries, and several other useful insights. Once dashboard shows information about the world cup in general, and the other dashboard gives you an insight on Argentina and gives you useful insights about Argentina in the past world cups. This project aims to provide insightful visualisations for better understanding and interpretation of the data.

## Process
Data Importation: I downloaded all of the raw data from Kaggle, and then imported it all into Microsoft Excel

Data Cleaning: I then formatted all the data into tables, making sure all the columns are in the correct formats, that there is no missing data, there is no duplicated data which is not needed, and corrected any errors and inconsistencies within the data. 

Data Analysis: I analysed the data to create useful insights, such as the top 10 highest goalscoring players, the top 10 highest scoring nations, etc. I did this by using a range of data analysis skills, such as VLookups, Excel Functions, and Pivot Tables. 

Data Visualisations: I used the pivot tables to then create insightful visualiations to show a range of insights in the two dashboards that I created
